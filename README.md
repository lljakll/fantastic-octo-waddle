## Milestone 4
<br>Milestone 4: Create a GUI model of the Minesweeper Game
<br>
<br>Activity Directions:  Create and build a Minesweeper GUI.  Your GUI must contain the following controls.
*A clickable cell class.  it is suggested that this class extend the Button class.
*A grid class that contains the cells.
<br>
<br>For this phase of the project, you do not have to worry about the Minesweeper Game logic.  Focus your attention on building an organized GUI.  Include a method that fires when a cell is clicked.  This method should do something visual, such as change the color of the cell or increment a counter.
<br>
<br>
Include a pop-up window that prompts the user to select an easy, medium, or difficult level. Use this selection to control the dimensions of the grid.  Example is in the Word Doc.
<br>
<br>Deliverables:  A clickable cell class that extends an existing C# control, a class that contains the grid, and a class that defines the window where the user selects the difficult
y level.
