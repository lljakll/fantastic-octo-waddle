## Milestone 6
<br>Milestone 6: Create a PlayerStats class that models a player's game data.  Add a "High Score" page to your application.  After every game, the high score page should display the top 5 scores for the corresponding level.  Player game data should be read from and written to an external file for persistent storage.
<br>
<br>Activity Directions:  In Minsweeper, a player's score is the time taken to successfully complete the game.  The player that takes tht least amount of time has the highest score.
<br>Begin this milestone by implementing a PlayerStats class.  This class should implement the IComparable interfaace and should contain attributes for the player's initials (or name), the level played, and the time.  You may add additional data if you wish.
<br>Next, add a high score form to your project.  The high score form should display at the end of every game and should dispay the top 5 scores for the corresponding game level.
<br>Finally, modify your program so that it contains a generic collection object.  When the application begins, populate the collection PlayerStats objects.  The PlayerStats objects are created with data read from the external file.  Use LINQ statements to query the collection to retrieve only the appropriate data for the high score form.
<br>
<br>Deliverables:  Program for the "High Score" window, the Statistics class, and functionality that dispays the appropriate high score information for the current game.
<br>
<br>What to submit:  Submit all cs. files to your git repository and to Loud Cloud as directed by your instructor.  Submit a screen shots as directd by your instructor.
