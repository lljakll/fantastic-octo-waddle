## Milestone 5
<br>Milestone 5: Combine GUI and Game Logic for the Minesweeper application and incorporate a stop watch to record time elapsed
<br>
<br>Activity Directions:  Add the game play logic to your GUI application.  Use the logic you developed in the console application version of the project.  Your goal is to be able to play a game to completion.  There are several "expected" features in the classic Minesweeper Game.  Be sure to implement these into your project.
*If a user clicks on a mine, the entire game board is revealed with "bomb" pictures on the mines and a "Game Over" message displays.
*If a user sucessfully exposes all squares without clicking on a mine, the entire game board is revealed with "flag" pictures on the mines and a "You Win" message displays.
*If a user right-clicks on a square, a "flag" picture is placed on the square.
<br>
<br>Add a stop watch to your application and record the length of time it takes a player to win the game  Display the elapsed time with he "You Win" message.
<br>
<br>Deliverables:  Program code for all updated files in your Minesweeper Class and a video presentation of your project.  Your video presentation should include explanations of code segments, game play and other challenges faced durin the development to this point.
<br>
<br>What to submit:  Submit all cs. files to your git repository and to Loud Cloud as directed by your instructor.  Be prepared to play your video in class and answer questions about your project.
